ANALYSIS REPORT FOR CATEGORY: TABLE
================================================================================

--- Section 1: Quantitative Summary (Entire Test Set) ---
Average Completion CD (vs. Ground Truth): 0.0049 (Lower is better)
Average Fidelity UCD (from Partial Input): 0.000162 (Lower is better)

--- Section 2: Qualitative Analysis of 5 Random Samples ---

--- Sample 1: 176 ---
AUTOMATED QUALITATIVE VERDICT:
- Alignment with Ground Truth: EXCELLENT. (CD: 0.0013, significantly better than category average of 0.0049)
- Fidelity to Partial Input: GOOD. The original visible geometry is well-preserved with minor deviations. (UCD: 0.000179, typical for this category)
  - Visual evidence saved to: /content/drive/MyDrive/shape-inversion/analysis_reports/table/table_sample_1.png

--- Sample 2: 194 ---
AUTOMATED QUALITATIVE VERDICT:
- Alignment with Ground Truth: EXCELLENT. (CD: 0.0030, significantly better than category average of 0.0049)
- Fidelity to Partial Input: POOR. The original visible geometry was significantly distorted during completion. (UCD: 0.000431, worse than category average of 0.000162)
