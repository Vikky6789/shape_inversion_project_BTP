ANALYSIS REPORT FOR CATEGORY: CAR
================================================================================

--- Section 1: Quantitative Summary (Entire Test Set) ---
Average Completion CD (vs. Ground Truth): 0.0118 (Lower is better)
Average Fidelity UCD (from Partial Input): 0.000179 (Lower is better)

--- Section 2: Qualitative Analysis of 5 Random Samples ---

--- Sample 1: 770 ---
AUTOMATED QUALITATIVE VERDICT:
- Alignment with Ground Truth: AVERAGE. (CD: 0.0141, typical for this category)
- Fidelity to Partial Input: GOOD. The original visible geometry is well-preserved with minor deviations. (UCD: 0.000278, typical for this category)
  - Visual evidence saved to: /content/drive/MyDrive/shape-inversion/analysis_reports/car/car_sample_1.png

--- Sample 2: 819 ---
AUTOMATED QUALITATIVE VERDICT:
- Alignment with Ground Truth: POOR. (CD: 0.0271, worse than category average of 0.0118)
- Fidelity to Partial Input: POOR. The original visible geometry was significantly distorted during completion. (UCD: 0.000393, worse than category average of 0.000179)
  - Visual evidence saved to: /content/drive/MyDrive/shape-inversion/analysis_reports/car/car_sample_2.png

--- Sample 3: 857 ---
AUTOMATED QUALITATIVE VERDICT:
- Alignment with Ground Truth: EXCELLENT. (CD: 0.0014, significantly better than category average of 0.0118)
- Fidelity to Partial Input: EXCELLENT. The original visible geometry is almost perfectly preserved. (UCD: 0.000070, significantly better than category average of 0.000179)
