ANALYSIS REPORT FOR CATEGORY: LAMP
================================================================================

--- Section 1: Quantitative Summary (Entire Test Set) ---
Average Completion CD (vs. Ground Truth): 0.0021 (Lower is better)
Average Fidelity UCD (from Partial Input): 0.000206 (Lower is better)

--- Section 2: Qualitative Analysis of 5 Random Samples ---

--- Sample 1: 673 ---
AUTOMATED QUALITATIVE VERDICT:
- Alignment with Ground Truth: EXCELLENT. (CD: 0.0005, significantly better than category average of 0.0021)
- Fidelity to Partial Input: GOOD. The original visible geometry is well-preserved with minor deviations. (UCD: 0.000116, typical for this category)
